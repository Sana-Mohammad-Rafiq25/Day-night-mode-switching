        <h2><a href="#"> whatthefork.is <span>·</span> <span>a closure</span></a></h2>

        <p>Closures are confusing because they are an “invisible” concept.</p>

        <p>When you use an object, a variable, or a function, you do this intentionally. You <br>think: “I’m gonna need a variable here,” and add it to your code.</p>

        <p>Closures are different. By the time most people approach closures, they have <br> already used them unknowingly many times — and it is likely that this is true for <br> yourself, too. So learning closures is less about understanding a new concept
            and <br> more about recognizing something you have already been doing for a while.</p>

        <h3><a href="#">tl;dr</a></h3>

        <p>You have a closure when <b>a function accesses variables defined outside of it.</b></p>

        <p>For example, this code snippet contains a closure:</p>

        <hr>

        <p>Notice how user => user.startsWith(query) is itself a function. It uses the query <br> variable. But the query variable is defined outside of that function. That’s a closure.</p>

        <hr>

        <p><b>You can stop reading here, if you want.</b> The rest of this article approaches closures <br> in a different way. Instead of explaining what a closure is, it will walk you through <br> the process of discovering closures — like the first programmers
            did in the 1960s.</p>

        <hr>

        <h3><a href="#">Step 1: Functions Can Access Outside Variables</a></h3>


        <p>To understand closures, we need to be somewhat familiar with variables and <br> functions. In this example, we declare the food variable inside the eat function:</p>


        <p>But what if we wanted to later change the food variable outside of the eat <br> function? To do this, we can move the food variable itself out of our function into <br> the top level:</p>

        <p>This lets us change the food “from the outside” any time that we want to:</p>
